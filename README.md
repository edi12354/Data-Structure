## 🔍 Examples

### Array Example

Here’s a simple example of how to use an array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Linked List Example

Here’s a basic linked list implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

class LinkedList {
public:
    Node* head;

    LinkedList() {
        head = nullptr;
    }

    void insert(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->next = head;
        head = newNode;
    }

    void display() {
        Node* current = head;
        while (current) {
            cout << current->data << " ";
            current = current->next;
        }
    }
};
```
